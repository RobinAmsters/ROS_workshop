    "# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problem is the problem of building a map of the environment while simultaneously determining the robot’s position relative to this map. This problem is also referred to as Concurrent Mapping and Localization (CML). A mobile robot moves through an unknown environment, starting at a known location (often given by coordinates {0,0,0}). Its motion is uncertain due to the robot’s model and sensor noise.\n",
    "As it roams, the robot can detect the environment using a form of observation measurement. To compute the map and the robot’s location within this map, the probability of accuracy of the data must be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "SLAM has received considerable attention since the 1990's. Several approaches have been proposed such as Kalman and Particle filter SLAM. Gmapping is arguably the most popular software implementation of SLAM. It employs a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) and builds a 2D map based on laser scan data. The code and documentation are available on the [OpenSLAM website](http://openslam.org/gmapping.html). It is very easy to integrate into ROS, and can even be run on a low cost robot-platform like the Turtlebot 3. This section will demonstrate how to start SLAM on this robot, how to visualize the data and how to record it for future use."

It is included in a full desktop install of ROS, but can of course be installed separately as well. rviz can display robot positions (with a complete robot model if it is provided in a URDF file), laser scans, point clouds and much information that is being published by ROS nodes.

    "to pan. On the left hand side of the window the display options are listed. The global options are listed at the top. Parameters like background color and frame rate can be adjusted here. There is also an option called 'Fixed Frame', which referes to the static coordinate frame relative to which all other information is referenced. By default, the frame 'odom' is selected, but 'base_footprint', 'world' and 'map' are also often used. The fixed frame should not be moving (e.g. it should not be attached to a mobile robot), doing so might result in erroneous visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below the global options, you can adjust the settings of the visualization grid, such as the cell size and the color. Below that, you will find the only topic that is shown by default, namely the /tf topic. tf is an abbreviation for transfer frame, and contains information about the relative location of all coordinate frames in the system. Eventually, all frames should be directly or indirectly referenced relative to the fixed frame, thus building a so called 'tf-tree'.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom left of the rviz window, the 'Add' button allows you to visualize additional topics. By selecting the LaserScan message type for example, an additional display option will appear. You can then set parameters like the laserscan topic and the size and color of the markers. You can add additional display options in a similar manner. You can even have two display options of the same type (for example, 2 camera displays). This option only makes sense when the data being displayed originates from different topics though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have added the desired display options, you can save your configuration as a .rviz file. Doing so will allow you to have the exact same visualization window in the future (and thus prevents having to add the same topics over and over again). To save your rviz file:\n",

    "## Gmapping with the Turtlebot 3\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now move on to a more practical example of SLAM in ROS. To this end, we will build a map using gmapping and a Turtlebot 3 robot. This robot has an onboad computer, namely a raspberry pi 3 (RPi). The RPi has sends commands to the motors and reads out the various sensors. It relays this information to a remote pc, which does the actual processing. The RPi's on our robots have been configured to function as an access point, which means that a connection from your computer to the robot can be established just like any other wifi-connection. There is no central connection point, and thus no central point of failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can move on to the actual mapping, a roscore needs to be started on the robot, which will listen to the roscore on your PC in a master/slave configuration. First start a roscore on your own pc, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flip the switch at the back of the Turtlebot to turn it on.\n",
    "2. On the remote PC (master) connect to the Turtlebot 3 wifi (password = groupRBP). It can take a few minutes for the robot to show in the available wireless connections.\n",
    "3. Establish an SSH (secure shell) connection:\n",
    "    1. Open a terminal and type: ssh rosberrypi@192.168.42.1\n",
    "    2. When prompted for a password, type: *groupRBP*. Unlike most applications, you will not see any symbols while typing the password. However, the keys are still being registered. So type the password and hit enter.\n",
    "    3. If you are asked to add rosberrypi to the list of known hosts, type 'yes' and press enter\n",
    "    4. If everything went as expected, the user in the terminal should have changed. All your commands should now be preceded by *'rosberrypi@rosberrypi'*. Any command you now type in this terminal is executed on the raspberry pi.\n",
    "4. Start a roscore on the pi with the following command: ```bringup```. Besides starting a regular roscore, communication with the LIDAR and motors is now initialized as well.\n",
    "5. To test that everything is working correctly, open a new terminal and type the following command on your own PC:\n",
    "```roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch```. To open terminal in a new tab of the same window, press CTRL+SHIFT+T.\n",
    "6. You should now be able to drive the Turtlebot around with your keyboard. When you are done, end the process with CTRL+C. Leave the other two terminals open.\n",
