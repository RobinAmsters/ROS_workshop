    "# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problem is the problem of building a map of the environment while simultaneously determining the robot’s position relative to this map. This problem is also referred to as Concurrent Mapping and Localization (CML). A mobile robot moves through an unknown environment, starting at a known location (often given by coordinates {0,0,0}). Its motion is uncertain due to the robot’s model and sensor noise.\n",
    "As it roams, the robot can detect the environment using a form of observation measurement. To compute the map and the robot’s location within this map, the probability of accuracy of the data must be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "SLAM has received considerable attention since the 1990's. Several approaches have been proposed such as Kalman and Particle filter SLAM. Gmapping is arguably the most popular software implementation of SLAM. It employs a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) and builds a 2D map based on laser scan data. The code and documentation are available on the [OpenSLAM website](http://openslam.org/gmapping.html). It is very easy to integrate into ROS, and can even be run on a low cost robot-platform like the Turtlebot 3. This section will demonstrate how to start SLAM on this robot, how to visualize the data and how to record it for future use."
