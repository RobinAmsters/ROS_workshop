    "# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problem is the problem of building a map of the environment while simultaneously determining the robot’s position relative to this map. This problem is also referred to as Concurrent Mapping and Localization (CML). A mobile robot moves through an unknown environment, starting at a known location (often given by coordinates {0,0,0}). Its motion is uncertain due to the robot’s model and sensor noise.\n",
    "As it roams, the robot can detect the environment using a form of observation measurement. To compute the map and the robot’s location within this map, the probability of accuracy of the data must be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "SLAM has received considerable attention since the 1990's. Several approaches have been proposed such as Kalman and Particle filter SLAM. Gmapping is arguably the most popular software implementation of SLAM. It employs a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) and builds a 2D map based on laser scan data. The code and documentation are available on the [OpenSLAM website](http://openslam.org/gmapping.html). It is very easy to integrate into ROS, and can even be run on a low cost robot-platform like the Turtlebot 3. This section will demonstrate how to start SLAM on this robot, how to visualize the data and how to record it for future use."

It is included in a full desktop install of ROS, but can of course be installed separately as well. rviz can display robot positions (with a complete robot model if it is provided in a URDF file), laser scans, point clouds and much information that is being published by ROS nodes. To start rviz, a roscore needs to be running:"

There is also an option called 'Fixed Frame', which referes to the static coordinate frame relative to which all other information is referenced. By default, the frame 'odom' is selected, but 'base_footprint', 'world' and 'map' are also often used. The fixed frame should not be moving (e.g. it should not be attached to a mobile robot), doing so might result in erroneous visualization. \n",

Below that, you will find the only topic that is shown by default, namely the /tf topic. tf is an abbreviation for transfer frame, and contains information about the relative location of all coordinate frames in the system. Eventually, all frames should be directly or indirectly referenced relative to the fixed frame, thus building a so called 'tf-tree'.\n",

You can even have two display options of the same type (for example, 2 camera displays). This option only makes sense when the data being displayed originates from different topics though.\n",
