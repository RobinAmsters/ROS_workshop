    "# What is ROS ?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS is an abbreviation for '*Robot Operating System*' and is **open source** robotics middleware, which means it is a collection of software frameworks for robotic software development. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management which can be used to create robot applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of ROS is to support the reuse of code. ROS is a distributed framework of processes that enables executables to be individually designed and loosely coupled. These processes are called **Nodes** and can be grouped into **Packages**. This makes sharing and distributing code easy. This type of collaboration is often achieved by using code **Repositories**. [Github](https://github.com/) is most often used to host these repositories. This allows you to more easily manage and maintain your projects.\n",
    " \n",
    "One can consider ROS to consist of 5 practical facets:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ros_facets.png\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROS enables modular software development by providing a library of free and reusable code packages. This makes robot development faster, easier and more reliable.\n",
    "- It provides a Run-Time Environment which supports communication between systems elements and data sharing. ROS does **not** enable real-time communication. This drawback is being addressed in [ROS2](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki).\n",
    "- ROS itself is not a standard of programming, but it provides conventions for creating and using ROS supported code in a repeatable and reliable way. For instance, ROS encourages the use of the same data structure to send data between different modules. \n",
    "- It also provides development tools for monitoring, visualizing and troubleshooting your robot software. \n",
    "- Finally, ROS has a large community consisting of thousands of users. This allows you to troubleshoot problems and ideas with other people and get assistance on your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other complementary software tools can be integrated into ROS like **[MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/)** for performing motion planning, manipulation of objects and navigation. **[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org)** is a physics engine that enables 3D simulation of robots in a user defined environment and can be easily connected to ROS.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does ROS work ?\n",
    "Each piece of code that executes a specific action in ROS is called a **node**. For example, Node1 reads in the angular displacement (odometry) of the wheels of a robot and determine where the robot is, Node2 is a path planner that tells you how to move from point A to B and Node3 is the motor controller which allows you to manipulate each wheel of your robot. A graphical representation of this program can be found below. \n",
    "\n",
    "These nodes need to communicate with each other in order to get the robot moving. This communication is done trough **topics** which is a named channel where nodes can send data to. This means that ROS nodes communicate using name based channels. The data that actually is sent to the topics are called **messages**. For example, the message sent to the `/odom` topic can be the current pose of the robot and the message sent to the `/cmd_vel` topic can be the velocity determined by the path planner in the quest to get from point A to point B. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/nodes_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These messages are a serialization format for structured data. It allows nodes written in different programming languages (often python and C++) to communicate with each other. This structure is defined in a .msg file.\n",
    "ROS has standard messages which can be used directly but you can also create your own .msg file to define a specific message structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS uses a **publish/subscribe** message model. This means that a node can log-on (subscribe) to a specific topic name for information and can publish information onto a topic name. Some properties of this model are:\n",
    "- Any node can publish a message to any topic\n",
    "- Any node can subscribe to any topic\n",
    "- Multiple nodes can publish to the same topic\n",
    "- Multiple nodes can subscribe to the same topic\n",
    "- A node can publish to multiple topics\n",
    "- A node can subscribe to multiple topics\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to be very flexible and adaptable with communication. But these nodes must be able to find each other in order to communicate with each other. For this purpose, a so called '*ROS master*' is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ROS master\n",
    "The role of the ROS master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another. It provides naming and registration services to the nodes in the ROS system. It tracks publishers and subscribers to topics as well as services (a tool for one-to-one communication in ROS). Once the nodes have located each other via the ROS master, they communicate with each other peer-to-peer. \n",
    "The ROS master is started by using the **roscore** or **roslaunch** command. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ros_master.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above image is a rough representation of the communication set up. First, the ROS master is activated. The nodes will, when activated, register to the master. The master knows which nodes are publishing on which topics and which nodes want to subscribe to which topic. The master in turn communicates back to the nodes so that a peer-to-peer connection can be established.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed explanation is represented by the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ros_master_detailed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a ROS master is started an address is connected to it. The nodes need to know the network address of the master on startup to be able to connect to it. That is why the address is initially hard coded to be localhost:11311.\n",
    "When a node is started, a random port number is assigned to it. For example the publisher node will be publishing a topic named /topic on localhost:4321. When the Subscriber node is started, it tells the ROS master that it wants to subscribe to the topic named /topic.\n",
    "The master in turn tells the subscriber node that this topic is published at localhost:4321. Next, the publisher and subscriber establish a connection in order to exchange data. \n",
    "Take note that the master does not handle any information being sent. It only initializes the connection between publisher and subscriber. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Services\n",
    "\n",
    "The publish/subscribe model of ROS is many-to-many one-way communication. This is not appropriate for **request/reply** interactions which are often required in a distributed system. Such a **request/reply** communication in ROS is achieved via a **service**. Service calls are bi-directional, one node sends information to another node and waits for a response, thus information flows in both directions. With normal ROS messages, there is no way to guarantee that someone is subscribing to the topic. Services also implement one-to-one communication, whereas messages on a topic may have many publishers and subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A service is defined by a pair of messages, one for request and one for reply. A node can register a specific service with the ROS master just as it registers/subscribes to its messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a <u>Camera node</u> which collects data from a camera and we have an <u>Image processing node</u> to process the images. This situation is depicted in the figure below. \n",
    "Say that we want to *request* data from the Camera node at a specific time to process it using the Image processing node. In this example the Image processing node first sends requests for /image_data. The Camera node collects the data from the camera and then sends a message over /image_data as a reply to the request.   \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/image_processing_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why ROS ?\n",
    "ROS is certainly not the only robotics middleware available. Other options are:\n",
    "- Urbi\n",
    "- MIRO\n",
    "- YARP\n",
    "- OpenRDK\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not go into detail on the structure and advantages of other available robotics middleware compared to ROS. We do not want to diminish their reputation or influence the reader on their choice of robotics middleware. Instead we will focus on the advantages and possibilities ROS has to offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since nodes are connected via a distributed message system, only the required nodes need to be called which can diminish the overall program size. This modularity also has the advantage that, if a component crashes, the whole system does not crash. For example, your robot can still continue its actions even if some sensors have died. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ROS is designed for a Linux operating system, however there is the possibility to install and use ROS on macOS and Microsoft Windows. Although these versions are experimental and will run on-top of the OS subsystem for Linux, they are supported by the ROS community. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ROS is not limited to one programming language. Nodes can be written in some of the most commonly used programming environments. You can write nodes in C++, Python, Java and LISP.  Note that C++ offers the most support and that ROS works with Python 2 and has not yet been ported to Python 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Through the  ROS community and the fact that ROS is open source, we can avoid the need to develop proprietary code for many aspects of robot control. Troubleshooting via the ROS community can be quick and effective. This makes the development of projects faster and easier. The tutorials on the wiki pages  help new users get comfortable with ROS, but can be quite technical or do not always explain the relevant concepts enough. However, the community of ROS can answer all questions and help you on your way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many of the other robotics middleware mentioned above can be integrated into ROS.  The new version of Urbi is compatible with ROS. This means that ROS users can use Urbiscript which provides features like parallelism and event-triggers for creating behavior scripts for robots. YARP and ROS can also be integrated with each other. This means that we can use ROS with existing YARP programs. This again allows you to  avoid to develop new scripts for robot control.\n",
